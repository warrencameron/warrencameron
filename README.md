<h1>Hi, I'm Warren. <br/><a href="https://github.com/warrencameron">Software Engineer</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/warren-cameron/">DevSecOps and Cybersecurity enthusiast</a>.</h1>

- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity, Python and drones
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Terraform and going thru the Google Cybersecurity Certificate as a refresher.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Cloud Computing

-  I am a results-oriented software engineer with advanced analytical, troubleshooting, problem-solving.
-  I have experience in computer Network Management and Systems Administration within a software research and development community.
-  I can work cooperatively and support a broad range of corporate IT initiatives.
-  I consistently improve delivery times and service levels while reducing costs. I excel at strategic planning, project management, and implementing best practice methodologies and continuous improvement programs.
-  I have experience in systems administration (Windows and Linux) and Configuration Management.
-  I am very passionate about technology and like to be curious about how things work.
-  I'm learning multiple things so that I can see where my current skills can be applied while using cloud technologies.
-  My mantra is "documentation beats conversation". I try to document everything. One, for my memory and two, for others to see what I'm doing and maybe learn something new.
