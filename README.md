- 📫 How to reach me ...

I am a results-oriented software engineer with advanced analytical, troubleshooting, problem-solving. I have experience in computer Network Management and Systems Administration within a software research and development community. Proven ability to work cooperatively and support a broad range of corporate IT initiatives. I consistently improve delivery times and service levels while reducing costs. I excel at strategic planning, project management, and implementing best practice methodologies and continuous improvement programs. 

I have experience in systems administration (Windows and Linux) and Configuration Management. My mantra is "documentation beats conversation". I try to document everything. One, for my memory and two, for others to see what I'm doing and maybe learn something new.

I am very passionate about technology and like to be curious about how things work. I am interested in cybersecurity and cloud technologies. Currently, I am learning how to use Terraform. I'm learning multiple things so that I can see where my current skills can be applied while using cloud technologies.
